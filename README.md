# 🔐 Cipher - ReactJS Encryption Algorithms  

Cipher is a **ReactJS-based encryption tool** that implements multiple classical cryptographic techniques, including:  
- **PlayFair Cipher**  
- **Rail Fence Cipher**  
- **Vigenère Cipher**  
- **Substitution Cipher**  
- **Shift (Caesar) Cipher**  

This project provides an interactive UI for users to apply these encryption methods and understand their mechanics.
